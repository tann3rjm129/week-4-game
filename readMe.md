### Pokemon Math Battle 

You'd think putting Pokemon in front of something like Math could make it more fun....OH AND IT DOES.

1. Each pokemon on the screen is valued with a secret number; click to find out it's value.
2. Your goal is to use the pokemon's corresponding values to add up to the target number. 
4. Add up to the target number exactly and score a win for your hometown!
5. Go over the target number and you'll be adding up those losses...bringing shame to your family. 
6. Get as many wins as possible. Enjoy!
